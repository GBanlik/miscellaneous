# Andrew NG's Machine learning Coursera

[!["Powered by Jupyter"](images/powered_by_logo.png)](https://jupyter.org/)

The repository contains solutions created for Andrew NG's Coursera Machine Learning course. It is subject to changes as the author sees fit.
The repository's structure is simple, the `main` repository containing the notebooks, and the `data` folder encompassing the support files - data.


All of the code is contained within the corresponding exercise's notebook.

### Exercises

The repository contains solutions for the exercises listed below.

| Exercise | Exercise Description | Jupyter Notebook |
